# 10. Multiplication Under Modulo 

You are given two numbers <strong>a and b</strong>. You need to find the multiplication of <strong>a and b</strong> under modulo <strong>M</strong>(M as <strong>10<sup>9</sup>+7</strong>).

### Example 1:
```
Input:
a = 92233720368547758
b = 92233720368547758
Output: 484266119
Explanation: Multiplication of a and b 
under modulo M will be 484266119.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input:
a = 1000000007
b = 1000000007
Output: 0
Explanation: Multiplication of a and b
under modulo M is 0.
```
### Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function <strong>multiplicationUnderModulo()</strong> that takes <strong>a and b as input parameters</strong> and <strong>returns multiplication</strong> of a and b under modulo M.


### Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
### Expected Auxiliary Space : O(1)

### Constraints:
1 <= a,b <= 2<sup>63</sup>-1
