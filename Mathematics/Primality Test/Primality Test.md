A prime number is a number which is only <strong>divisible by 1 and itself</strong>.
Given number <strong>N</strong> check if it is prime or not.

### Example 1:
```
Input:
N = 5

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function <strong>isPrime()</strong> that takes <strong>N</strong> as input parameter and returns <strong>True</strong> if <strong>N</strong> is prime else returns <strong>False</strong>. 


### Expected Time Complexity: O(N<sup>1/2</sup>)
### Expected Auxiliary Space : O(1)

### Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10<sup>9</sup>
