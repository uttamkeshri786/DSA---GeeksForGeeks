# 2. Convert Celsius To Fahrenheit

Given a temperature in celsius <strong>C</strong>. You need to convert the given temperature to <strong>Fahrenheit</strong>.

### Example 1:
```
Input:
C = 32
Output: 89
Explanation: Using the conversion 
formula of celsius to farhenheit , it
can be calculated that, for 32 degree
C, the temperature in Fahrenheit = 89.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input:
50
Output: 122
Explanation: Using the conversion 
formulaof celsius to farhenheit, it
can be calculated that, for 50 degree
C, the temperature in Fahrenheit = 122.
```
### Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function <strong>CtoF()</strong> that takes <strong>C</strong> as <strong>parameter</strong> and returns temperature in fahrenheit( in double). The flooring and printing is <strong>automatically</strong> done by the <strong>driver code</strong>.


### Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
### Expected Auxiliary Space : O(1)

### Constraints:
1 <= C <= 10<sup>4</sup>
