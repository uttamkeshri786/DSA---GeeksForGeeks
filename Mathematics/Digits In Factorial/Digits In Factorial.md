# 5. Digits In Factorial 

Given an integer <strong>N</strong>. Find the number of digits that appear in its factorial. 
Factorial is defined as, factorial(n) = 1*2*3*4……..*N and factorial(0) = 1.

### Example 1:
```
Input: N = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: Factorial of 5 is 120.
Number of digits in 120 is 3 (1, 2, and 0)
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: N = 120
Output: 199
Explanation: The number of digits in
120! is 199
```
### Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function <strong>digitsInFactorial()</strong> that takes <strong>N</strong> as input parameter and returns <strong>number of digits</strong> in factorial of <strong>N</strong>.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
### Expected Auxiliary Space : O(1)

### Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>
