### 1. There are three numbers a, b, c in G.P. such that a + b + c = 14. If a and b are increased by 1 and c is decreased by 1 then the series formed by these numbers is in A.P. Calculate the value for a*b*c ?

        A. 64
        B. 105
        C. 128
        D. 150

Ans: A
#### Explanation
Given, a + b + c = 14

a' = a +1
b' = b +1
c' = c -1

a' + b' + c' = 15
2b' = a' + c'

15 - b' = 2b'
b' = 5
b = 4
a' + b' =10
By hit and trial,

a' = 3, b' = 5, c' = 7 and,
a = 2, b = 4, c = 8


### 2. There are n terms in an A.P. where n is even. The sum of odd terms and even terms are 63 and 72 respectively. The last term is greater than first term by 16.5 , Calculate n.

        A. 10
        B. 12
        C. 14
        D. 16

Ans: B
#### Explanation
(Number of terms / 2) * Common difference = (Sum of even terms - Sum of odd terms )

(n/2) * d = 72 - 63
nd= 18

d= common difference

Last term - first term = 16.5
(n-1)d = 16.5
nd - d = 16.5
d = 1.5
n = 12


### 3. In an experiment, one red dice and one black dice(both are fair) are rolled. What is the probability that,

        1. The number on black dice will divide the number on red dice.
        2. Number on black dice is multiple of the number on red dice.

        A. 22 / 36 and 14 / 36 respectively
        B. 12 / 36 and 18 / 36 respectively
        C. 14 / 36 and 14 /36 respectively
        D. 6 / 36 and 8 / 36 respectively

Ans: C
#### Explanation
We have two dice one is black and the other one is red:

There will be a total of 36 outcomes.

<ol>
<li>We have to find the probability of the outcome that the number on black dice divides the number on red dice.
<ul>
<li>1 divides 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</li>

<li>2 divides 2, 4, 6.</li>

<li>3 divides 3, 6.</li>

<li>4 divides 4.</li>

<li>5 divides 5.</li>

<li>6 divides 6.</li>
</ul>


There are 14 number which will be counted as favorable outcomes.
Therefor, probability = favorable outcome / total outcome.
i.e. = 14 / 36.</li>

<li>We have to find the probability that the number on black dice is multiple of number on red dice.
<ul>
<li>1 is multiple of 1</li>

<li>2 is multiple of 1 and 2.</li>

<li>3 is multiple of 1 and 3.</li>

<li>4 is multiple of 1, 2 and 4</li>

<li>5 is multiple of 1 and 5.</li>

<li>6 is multiple of 1, 2, 3 and 6.</li>
</ul>


There are 14 number which will be counted in favourable outcome;
probability = favorable outcome / total outcome.
i.e. = 14 / 36.</li>
</ol>


### 4. What will be the remainder when (7)<sup>100</sup> is divided by 5?

        A. 0
        B. 1
        C. 2
        D. 3

Ans: B
#### Explanation
This is a basic question of Chinese remainder theorem(CRT):

We can write 7<sup>100</sup> as (7<sup>4</sup>)<sup>25</sup>.

Now, 7<sup>4</sup> = 2401 when we divide it by 5 then 1 will be the remainder.

Now, 7<sup>100</sup> as (7<sup>4</sup>)<sup>25</sup> = (2401)<sup>25</sup> mod 5 = 1<sup>25</sup> mod 5 = 1.

Therefore, (7<sup>100</sup> % 5) = 1.


### 5. What is the probability of getting a Saturday in a Week?

        A. 1
        B. 1/7
        C. 1/2
        D. 2/7
        E. 0

Ans: A
#### Explanation
Total number of Saturdays in a week = 1.
The possible number of Saturdays in a week = 1.

Therefore, the probability of getting a Saturday in a week = (1/1) = 1.


### 6. Five full-time employees and 6 interns work 12 hours a day and finish a task in 20 days. 8 full-time employees and 18 interns work 10 hours a day and finish the same task in 12 days. How many are working hours per day required if 5 full-time employees and 6 interns work for 30 days to finish the same amount of work? We may assume that changing number of people in a group does not change productivity.
 
        A. 8 hours a day
        B. 7 hours a day
        C. 6 hours a day
        D. 5 hours a day

Ans: A
#### Explanation
(5 full time + 6 interns) * 12 * 20 = (8 full time + 18 interns) * 10 * 12
(5 full time + 6 interns) * 2 = (8 full time + 18 interns)
2 full time = 6 interns
1 full time = 3 interns.
Now (8 full time + 18 interns) * 10 * 12 = (5 full time + 6 interns) * x * 30
42 interns * 12 * 10 = 21 interns * x * 30
X = 8 hours a day.


### 7. Find the missing numbers in the series:
        4, 6, 8, 9, _, 12, 14, 15, _, 18. . . . 
        
        A. 11 and 17 respectively.
        B. 10 and 16 respectively.
        C. 11 and 16 respectively.
        D. 10 and 17 respectively.

Ans: B
#### Explanation
Given series is the list of composite numbers.


### 8. There are m multiples of 6 in range [0, 100] and n multiples of 6 in [-6, 35]. Find out the value of X, if X = m - n. Where X, m, and n are positive integer.

        A. 9
        B. 10
        C. 11
        D. 12

Ans: B
#### Explanation
There are 17 multiple of 6 in between 0 and 100. So, m = 17.
There 7 multiple of 6 in between -6 and 35. So, n = 7.
X = m - n = 17 - 7 = 10.


### 9. A is running @ 20 m / s on a circular track of 400 m and B is running on the same track @ 16 m / s in opposite direction. After 5 minutes from starting how many times they have crossed each other on starting point?

        A. One time
        B. Two time
        C. Three time
        D. Four time

Ans: C
#### Explanation
Meeting for the first time on a circular track = LCM (circumference / speed of A, circumference / speed of B )
= LCM( 400 / 20, 400 / 16)
= LCM( 20, 25) = 100 sec.
In 100 second they will meet for the first time on starting point.
Similarly 2 time in 200 sec and after 300 sec(i.e. 5 minute) they had crossed each other on starting point 3 times.
So, option (C) is correct.


### 10. Find the sum of the series:
        128, 64, 32, 16, 8, … upto infinity.

        A. Infinity
        B. 0
        C. 128
        D. 256

Ans: D
#### Explanation
First term, a = 128
Common ratio, r = 64 / 128 = 0.5
We know that for an infinite GP, Sum of terms = a / (1 – r)
-> Sum of terms of the GP = 128 / (1 – 0.5) = 128 / 0.5 = 256
