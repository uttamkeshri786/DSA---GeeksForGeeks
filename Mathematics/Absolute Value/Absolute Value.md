# 1. Absolute Value 

You are given an interger I, find the absolute value of the interger I.

### Example 1:
```
Input:
I = -32
Output: 32
Explanation: 
The absolute value of -32 is 32.
```

### Example 2:

### Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function <strong>absolute()</strong> which takes an integer I as input parameter and return the absolute value of <strong>I</strong>.

 

### Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
### Expected Auxiliary Space : O(1)

### Constraints:
-10<sup>6</sup> <= I <= 10<sup>6</sup>
